# Sound Visualizer

Anders Bando-Hess and Isaac Gluck - September 2018

[Demo](http://bandohess.com/SoundVis/index.html)

### Description
Our visualizer takes sound input from the microphone, and calculates volume and frequencies. Higher volumes cause the particles in the visualizer to expand outwards, while different frequencies cause the particles to change colors. High frequencies correspond to red, middle frequencies to green, and low frequencies to blue.

### Who did what
Andy wrote the code to take input from the microphone, and use that input to calculate how far particles should expand and how their colors should change. Isaac wrote the code to display the particles on the screen. Both Andy and Isaac worked on the math to determine how fast particles should move and where they should appear in the circle.

### What we learned
We learned how to use THREE.js and microphone input

### What didn't work
We couldn't figure out how to make our project work with the newest version of THREE.js
